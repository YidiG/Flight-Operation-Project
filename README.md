# Flight-Operation-Project

**Objective:** The objective of this project is to examine and assess the delayed flight data of a regional US airline. The dataset provided contains information about various features related to flight operations, including flight numbers, origin and destination airports, scheduled departure time, actual departure time, flight delays, flight time, distance between airports, and various delay components.

**Data Description:** The dataset consists of 7500 rows and 14 columns, with each row representing a flight operation record. The columns in the dataset include:
1. Region where the origin airport is located (i.e. East, West)
2. Flight Number
3. Origin Airport
4. Destination Airport
5. Scheduled Departure Time
6. Actual Departure Time
7. Actual Departure Delay (negative numbers indicate early departure)
8. Flight Time, in Minutes
9. Distance between airports (miles)
10. Carrier Delay in Minutes
11. Weather Delay in Minutes
12. National Air System Delay in Minutes
13. Security Delay in Minutes
14. Late Aircraft Delay in Minutes

**Analysis Approach:** In this project, we will analyze the delayed flight data to gain insights into flight operations, identify patterns of delays, and understand the factors that contribute to delays. We will use data visualization techniques to explore the data and examine the relationships between different variables. Additionally, we may perform statistical analysis to uncover trends and patterns in the dataset.

**Expected Outcomes:** Through this analysis, we expect to identify the main causes of flight delays and assess their impact on flight operations for the regional US airline. The insights obtained will enable the airline to take appropriate measures to reduce delays, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.

**Significance:** Timely and efficient flight operations are crucial for the success of any airline. By examining and assessing the delayed flight data, this project aims to provide valuable information to the regional US airline, enabling them to make data-driven decisions, optimize their operations, and minimize flight delays. Ultimately, this will result in improved service reliability, customer experience, and overall performance for the airline.

The use of data analysis and visualization techniques will provide a comprehensive understanding of the flight operations, allowing the airline to make informed decisions and implement strategies that contribute to smoother and more efficient flight experiences for their passengers.
